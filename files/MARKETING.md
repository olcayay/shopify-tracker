# AppRanks — Shopify App Store Intelligence Platform

> Track rankings, monitor competitors, optimize keywords — all in one place.

## The Problem

The Shopify App Store is a black box for developers.

- **No ranking history.** You can see your current category position, but there's no way to track how it changes over time — or what caused the change.
- **Competitor monitoring is manual.** Checking if a competitor changed their pricing, added features, or gained reviews means visiting their listing every day.
- **Keyword optimization is guesswork.** You don't know which keywords drive traffic, where you rank for them, or who's advertising on them.
- **Featured placements are invisible.** When Shopify features an app in a category or on the homepage, there's no record of it.
- **Review analysis is time-consuming.** Comparing review trends across your app and competitors requires spreadsheets and manual tracking.
- **Market research takes hours.** Understanding category dynamics, competitive density, and market opportunities means crawling through hundreds of listings.

AppRanks solves all of this with automated tracking, historical data, and a single dashboard.

## What Makes AppRanks Different

### Complete Historical Data
Every data point is stored as a snapshot. Unlike tools that only show current state, AppRanks lets you look back and understand trends, seasonality, and the impact of your changes.

### Automated 24/7 Monitoring
Data collection runs on a continuous schedule — no manual refreshes needed:
- Category rankings: Updated daily
- App details: Updated every 12 hours
- Keyword rankings: Updated every 12 hours
- Reviews: Collected daily (90-day window)
- Metrics (velocity, similarity): Pre-computed after each collection

### Review Momentum — Not Just Counts
Most tools tell you how many reviews you have. AppRanks tells you if your review acquisition is accelerating, stable, or slowing — and how you compare to competitors at the same granularity.

### Multi-Dimensional Similarity Scoring
Understand how similar your app truly is to competitors across four independent dimensions: categories, features, keywords, and content. Not a single number — a breakdown you can act on.

### Ad Intelligence
See which competitors are spending money on keyword and category ads, how often, and on which days. Understand ad strategies without guessing.

### Real-Time Change Detection
When a competitor changes their description, updates pricing, adds features, or modifies their SEO — you'll know. Field-level tracking catches every modification.

### All-in-One Platform
Rankings, reviews, keywords, competitors, ads, featured placements, categories, features, integrations, developers — everything in a single dashboard. No need to juggle multiple tools.
