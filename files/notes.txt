Settings page profile edit & direct user creation notes:

- PATCH /api/auth/me extended: name, email (uniqueness check), password change (current password verification)
- POST /api/account/members added: owner-only direct user creation (email, name, password, role)
- JWT email update: no re-issuing needed, next token refresh (15min) picks up new email
- Invitation API routes kept for backward compatibility, just not used from dashboard anymore
- bcrypt imported in account.ts for password hashing in user creation

Scraping depth documentation:
- Created files/SCRAPING-DEPTH.md documenting all cron job schedules, pagination limits, stop conditions, cascade behavior, rate limiting, and data flow

Dashboard table links & competitors self-row:
- Overview and /apps pages: table cells (Reviews, Competitors, Keywords, Ranked, Last Change) now link to their respective detail pages
- /apps/[slug]/competitors: tracked app itself shown at top with green highlight (border-l-emerald-500 bg-emerald-500/10)
- API: GET /api/account/tracked-apps/:slug/competitors?includeSelf=true prepends self app with isSelf flag
- Self row excluded from reorder/delete actions, always pinned to top when sorting
- Migration startup wrapped in try-catch for idempotent restarts
- SCRAPING-DEPTH.md updated with keyword suggestion details (storage, cascade scoping)

Developer page table enrichment:
- /api/apps/by-developer now returns isBuiltForShopify, launchedDate, minPaidPrice (computed from pricingPlans)
- Developer page table matches /apps page: sortable columns, BFS badge, linked Reviews/Min. Paid/Last Change cells, Categories with ranking, Launched date
- Batch-fetches categories and last-changes in parallel after loading apps

Compare page keyword density & test mode:
- Added KeywordDensityTable component with stop word filtering, grouped by count (only count > 1)
- useKeywordDensity hook: tokenizes text, filters stop words, groups keywords by frequency, calculates density %
- App Details section now uses side-by-side layout (text left, keyword density table right)
- Collapsible "Test a new description" panel: textarea with CharBadge, Analyze/Clear buttons
- When analyzed, shows draft text + keyword density table in grid-cols-2 layout
