Settings page profile edit & direct user creation notes:

- PATCH /api/auth/me extended: name, email (uniqueness check), password change (current password verification)
- POST /api/account/members added: owner-only direct user creation (email, name, password, role)
- JWT email update: no re-issuing needed, next token refresh (15min) picks up new email
- Invitation API routes kept for backward compatibility, just not used from dashboard anymore
- bcrypt imported in account.ts for password hashing in user creation
