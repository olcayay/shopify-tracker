Settings page profile edit & direct user creation notes:

- PATCH /api/auth/me extended: name, email (uniqueness check), password change (current password verification)
- POST /api/account/members added: owner-only direct user creation (email, name, password, role)
- JWT email update: no re-issuing needed, next token refresh (15min) picks up new email
- Invitation API routes kept for backward compatibility, just not used from dashboard anymore
- bcrypt imported in account.ts for password hashing in user creation

Scraping depth documentation:
- Created files/SCRAPING-DEPTH.md documenting all cron job schedules, pagination limits, stop conditions, cascade behavior, rate limiting, and data flow

Dashboard table links & competitors self-row:
- Overview and /apps pages: table cells (Reviews, Competitors, Keywords, Ranked, Last Change) now link to their respective detail pages
- /apps/[slug]/competitors: tracked app itself shown at top with green highlight (border-l-emerald-500 bg-emerald-500/10)
- API: GET /api/account/tracked-apps/:slug/competitors?includeSelf=true prepends self app with isSelf flag
- Self row excluded from reorder/delete actions, always pinned to top when sorting
- Migration startup wrapped in try-catch for idempotent restarts
- SCRAPING-DEPTH.md updated with keyword suggestion details (storage, cascade scoping)

Developer page table enrichment:
- /api/apps/by-developer now returns isBuiltForShopify, launchedDate, minPaidPrice (computed from pricingPlans)

- Collapsible "Test a new description" panel: textarea with CharBadge, Analyze/Clear buttons
- When analyzed, shows draft text + keyword density table in grid-cols-2 layout

Category ad sightings — historical tracking:
- New DB table: category_ad_sightings (appSlug, categorySlug, seenDate, timesSeenInDay, firstSeenRunId, lastSeenRunId)
- Unique index on (appSlug, categorySlug, seenDate) with upsert-on-conflict for timesSeenInDay increment
- Category scraper: recordCategoryAdSightings() called for every page (first + additional), filters is_sponsored apps
- API: GET /api/apps/:slug/category-ad-sightings and GET /api/categories/:slug/ads endpoints
- Dashboard: App Ads page split into "Keyword Ad History" + "Category Ad History" cards
- Dashboard: Category page gets "Sponsored Apps" heatmap section with empty state
- CLI: categories command now accepts optional slug for single-category scrape
