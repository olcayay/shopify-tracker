Fix broken category links (PLA-18):
- App scraper now registers missing categories at scrape time
  - After inserting app snapshot, loops through details.categories and upserts each slug into categories table
  - Uses ON CONFLICT (slug) DO NOTHING — never overwrites richer data from category crawler
  - New categories created with isTracked=false, categoryLevel=0, isListingPage=true
- Dashboard category "not found" page improved
  - Shows "Category not indexed yet" heading with helpful explanation
  - Links back to /categories to browse all categories
  - Styled consistently with other empty states (centered, py-16)
- Backfill job: backfill_categories job reads latest snapshot per tracked app, extracts category slugs, inserts missing ones
  - New scraper_type enum value added via migration 0037
  - Registered in process-job.ts, admin API validTypes, scraper dashboard page
  - Triggerable from system-admin scraper page
- Files changed: app-details-scraper.ts, categories/[slug]/page.tsx, backfill-categories.ts, queue.ts, process-job.ts, scrape-runs.ts, system-admin.ts, scraper/page.tsx

App search & browse feature:
- New reusable AppSearchBar component (components/app-search-bar.tsx) with 3 modes: follow, competitor, browse-only
- Search results show app icon, name (clickable Link to /apps/{slug}), rating/reviews, and status badges (Following/Competitor/This app)
- + button action depends on mode: follow mode adds as my app, competitor mode adds as competitor
- + button has title tooltip on hover explaining the action
- Browse (clicking app name) available to all roles; action buttons only for owner/editor
- Replaced duplicated inline search code in /apps/page.tsx and competitors-section.tsx
- Added search to homepage (My Apps card: follow mode, Competitor Apps card: browse-only)
- Added search to /competitors page (browse-only mode)
- API: added iconUrl to GET /api/apps/search response

Settings page profile edit & direct user creation notes:

- PATCH /api/auth/me extended: name, email (uniqueness check), password change (current password verification)
- POST /api/account/members added: owner-only direct user creation (email, name, password, role)
- JWT email update: no re-issuing needed, next token refresh (15min) picks up new email
- Invitation API routes kept for backward compatibility, just not used from dashboard anymore
- bcrypt imported in account.ts for password hashing in user creation

Scraping depth documentation:
- Created files/SCRAPING-DEPTH.md documenting all cron job schedules, pagination limits, stop conditions, cascade behavior, rate limiting, and data flow

Dashboard table links & competitors self-row:
- Overview and /apps pages: table cells (Reviews, Competitors, Keywords, Ranked, Last Change) now link to their respective detail pages
- /apps/[slug]/competitors: tracked app itself shown at top with green highlight (border-l-emerald-500 bg-emerald-500/10)
- API: GET /api/account/tracked-apps/:slug/competitors?includeSelf=true prepends self app with isSelf flag
- Self row excluded from reorder/delete actions, always pinned to top when sorting
- Migration startup wrapped in try-catch for idempotent restarts
- SCRAPING-DEPTH.md updated with keyword suggestion details (storage, cascade scoping)

Developer page table enrichment:
- /api/apps/by-developer now returns isBuiltForShopify, launchedDate, minPaidPrice (computed from pricingPlans)
- Developer page table matches /apps page: sortable columns, BFS badge, linked Reviews/Min. Paid/Last Change cells, Categories with ranking, Launched date
- Batch-fetches categories and last-changes in parallel after loading apps

Compare page keyword density & test mode:
- Added KeywordDensityTable component with stop word filtering, grouped by count (only count > 1)
- useKeywordDensity hook: tokenizes text, filters stop words, groups keywords by frequency, calculates density %
- App Details section now uses side-by-side layout (text left, keyword density table right)
- Collapsible "Test a new description" panel: textarea with CharBadge, Analyze/Clear buttons
- When analyzed, shows draft text + keyword density table in grid-cols-2 layout

Review velocity & acceleration metrics:
- New DB table: app_review_metrics (v7d, v30d, v90d, accMicro, accMacro, momentum)
- Computation job counts reviews from reviews table (COUNT FILTER WHERE review_date >= N days ago)
- Review scraper updated: sort_by=newest, 90-day cutoff, max 50 pages
- Reviews worker auto-triggers metrics computation after scraping (no separate cron needed)
- API: POST /api/apps/review-velocity bulk endpoint, competitors endpoints enriched
- Dashboard: R7d, R30d, R90d, Momentum columns on competitors page, per-app competitors, app-list-table
- MomentumBadge component with emoji states (Accelerating/Stable/Slowing/Spike/Flat)
- Instant tooltips on table headers using Radix UI Tooltip (delayDuration=0)
- Admin can still manually trigger compute_review_metrics from scraper page

Competitors page enhancements (pin, rank change, avg sort, percentile):
- Pin toggle for self app: Pin/PinOff icon in # column, toggles sticky-at-top vs sorted naturally
- State persisted in localStorage per appSlug (competitors-pin-self-{appSlug})
- Category rank change: API query enhanced with LAG() window function to get prev_position
- Displayed as (#5 (+2)) in green for improvement, red for drops
- Cat. Rank sorting changed from best (min) rank to average rank across all categories
- Category percentile: API enhanced with LEFT JOIN LATERAL to category_snapshots for app_count
- Displayed as "Top X%" with tooltip showing "Rank N of M apps"
- Single combined SQL query serves both rank change and percentile (no extra round trips)

Competitors table UI polish & column visibility:
- Column visibility toggle: Settings2 icon button next to search bar opens Radix DropdownMenu
- 15 toggleable columns (Rating through Last Change); #, App, Action always visible
- Hidden columns persisted in localStorage per appSlug (competitors-columns-{appSlug})
- Show all / Hide all bulk actions at top of dropdown
- Badge on settings icon shows count of hidden columns
- Scrollable dropdown list (max-h-300px) with tooltips on non-obvious column names
- Hiding sorted column resets sort to default order
- MomentumBadge: icon stacked above label (flex-col), Category Rank header expanded from "Cat. Rank"
- Pricing column abbreviated with tooltip, Shopify external link per row, frozen #/App columns

Category ad sightings — historical tracking:
- New DB table: category_ad_sightings (appSlug, categorySlug, seenDate, timesSeenInDay, firstSeenRunId, lastSeenRunId)
- Unique index on (appSlug, categorySlug, seenDate) with upsert-on-conflict for timesSeenInDay increment
- Category scraper: recordCategoryAdSightings() called for every page (first + additional), filters is_sponsored apps
- API: GET /api/apps/:slug/category-ad-sightings and GET /api/categories/:slug/ads endpoints
- Dashboard: App Ads page split into "Keyword Ad History" + "Category Ad History" cards
- Dashboard: Category page gets "Sponsored Apps" heatmap section with empty state
- CLI: categories command now accepts optional slug for single-category scrape

App similarity scores — multi-dimensional scoring:
- New DB table: app_similarity_scores (appSlugA, appSlugB, overallScore, categoryScore, featureScore, keywordScore, textScore, computedAt)
- Canonical ordering: appSlugA < appSlugB, unique index on (appSlugA, appSlugB)
- Jaccard index for each dimension: category slug overlap, feature_handle overlap, keyword ranking overlap, tokenized text overlap
- Text similarity: name + subtitle + appIntroduction, tokenized with stop words removed (English + Shopify-specific)
- Weighted average: 25% each for category, feature, keyword, text
- Pre-computed via compute_similarity_scores job (same pattern as compute_review_metrics)
- Job collects all unique (trackedApp, competitor) pairs across accounts, batch-fetches data, computes in memory
- API: competitors endpoint enriched with similarityScore { overall, category, feature, keyword, text }
- Dashboard: Similarity column on competitors table with progress bar + percentage, color-coded (red >=70%, amber 40-69%, green <40%)
- Tooltip shows 4 component breakdowns, sortable, toggleable column
- Admin scraper page: manual trigger for compute_similarity_scores job

Unit test infrastructure & pre-commit hooks:
- Vitest + @testing-library/react + @testing-library/jest-dom + @testing-library/user-event + jsdom
- 510 tests across 39 test files covering all pages, components, lib functions, API, proxy routing, auth, system admin, scraper, settings, invitation
- Test categories: lib utilities (cn, format-date, tag-colors, analytics), auth context, UI components (confirm-modal, pagination, velocity, momentum, keyword-tag, skeletons, sidebar, star-buttons), landing page components (hero, features, problem, how-it-works, differentiators, CTA, footer, header), auth pages (login, register, invitation accept), legal pages (terms, privacy), system admin pages (dashboard, users list, user detail, accounts list, account detail, scraper management, apps list, keywords list, packages, features list), settings page, API functions (47 tests), proxy routing (22 tests)
- Husky v9 pre-commit hook: runs ESLint (blocks on errors) + Vitest (blocks on test failures)
- ESLint 9 flat config: React Compiler rules + TypeScript strict rules downgraded to warnings
- Global test setup mocks: next/navigation, next/link, next/headers, radix-ui (Slot + VisuallyHidden), IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, matchMedia
- Test utils: mock user/admin/viewer objects, mock account, setupAuthMock helper for per-test auth overrides

Keyword grouping (PLA-11):
- Pure frontend feature, no API/DB changes
- New utility: lib/keyword-word-groups.ts — extractWordGroups() splits keywords into words, counts frequency (min 2), filters stop words (a/the/for/app/apps etc.), returns sorted by count desc then alphabetically
- filterKeywordsByWord() uses whole-word matching (not substring) to avoid "ai" matching "email"
- Words deduplicated within a single keyword, case-insensitive, min 2 chars
- New component: KeywordWordGroupFilter — visually distinct from tags: dashed border, rounded-md (not pill), monochrome (no colors), count badge suffix, "Common words:" label
- Single-select toggle (vs tags' multi-select), AND logic with tag filter
- Word groups computed from full keyword list (not filtered), so buttons stay stable when tag filter is active
- useEffect clears activeWordFilter if the word disappears from wordGroups after keyword add/remove
- 26 new tests (18 utility + 8 component)

Keyword suggestions from app metadata (PLA-10):
- New shared utility: packages/shared/src/keyword-extraction.ts — pure function, no DB dependency
- N-gram generation: unigrams (4+ chars, not stop word), bigrams (1+ non-stop), trigrams (2+ non-stop)
- 7 weighted fields: name(10), subtitle(5), introduction(4), categories(3), features(2), description(2), categoryFeatures(2)
- Word count multiplier: 1-word=1x, 2-word=2x, 3-word=3x boosts multi-word keywords
- Filters: must appear in primary field (name/subtitle/intro/description), min 2 fields, max 3 words
- Scores accumulate across fields — same keyword in name(10) + subtitle(5) = 15
- Stop words: common English + Shopify-specific (app, store, tool, solution, powerful, easy, etc.)
- API: GET /api/account/tracked-apps/:slug/keyword-suggestions?debug=true&limit=100
- API returns tracked:boolean per keyword (no longer filtered out, shown as "Added" in UI)
- Computed on-demand (not pre-stored), 4 simple indexed queries + in-memory scoring
- Dashboard component: MetadataKeywordSuggestions with prominent/normal modes
- Prominent mode (empty state): auto-opens, larger CTA button, integrated into keywords empty state
- Normal mode: collapsible "Suggest keywords" outline button above keyword table
- UI shows: keyword, source field badges, count × score, Shopify search link, Add/Added state
- Weight legend footer for algorithm transparency during iteration
- 35 new tests (24 extraction algorithm + 11 component)

Keyword loading states & polling (PLA-13):
- When a new keyword is added with scraperEnqueued:true, its keywordId is tracked in pendingKeywordIds Set
- Polling: useEffect with setInterval (5s) fetches keywords when pendingKeywordIds is non-empty
- When a pending keyword gets latestSnapshot !== null, it moves to resolvedKeywordIds for animation
- Pending state: Skeleton pulse in ranking cells + Skeleton + Loader2 spinner in Total Results cell
- New row: animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-top CSS animation on the TableRow
- Resolved state: animate-in fade-in duration-700 on ranking and results cells (2s auto-clear)
- No API changes — uses existing keywordId, scraperEnqueued, latestSnapshot fields
- onKeywordAdded callback signature changed to (keywordId?, scraperEnqueued?) across MetadataKeywordSuggestions and KeywordSuggestionsModal
- Both suggestion components now parse POST response and forward keywordId/scraperEnqueued to parent

Competitor loading states & polling (PLA-15):
- Same pattern as PLA-13 keywords, applied to competitors page (/apps/[slug]/competitors)
- API: POST competitor endpoint always returns scraperEnqueued=true (enqueues scrape pipeline)
  - Unlike keywords, competitor apps often already have a basic snapshot from search
  - The scrape pipeline (app_details → reviews → compute_review_metrics → compute_similarity_scores) produces enriched data
- Frontend: pendingCompetitorSlugs Map<string, number> (slug → addedAt timestamp) + resolvedCompetitorSlugs Set
- loadCompetitors() accepts silent=true param to skip full table skeleton
- addCompetitor() uses silent load + tracks pending slug when scraperEnqueued=true
- Polling: 5s interval when pendingCompetitorSlugs is non-empty, refreshes competitors + last changes
- Resolution: when reviewVelocity !== null OR similarityScore !== null (enriched data from compute jobs)
  - 120s timeout fallback for edge cases where compute jobs don't produce output
- Skeleton shown only on compute-job cells (similarity, v7d/v30d/v90d, momentum)
- Already-available cells (rating, reviews, pricing, featured, etc.) show actual data immediately
- Loader2 spinner next to app name while pending
- Resolved cells: animate-in fade-in duration-700 animation (2s auto-clear)
- New row: animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-top on the TableRow
- Files changed: account.ts (API), competitors-section.tsx (dashboard)

Keyword alphabetical sorting (PLA-16):
- "Keyword" table header in keywords-section.tsx is now clickable to sort alphabetically
- Uses sortBySlug === "_alpha" as a special value (distinct from app slugs used for ranking sort)
- localeCompare for proper alphabetical ordering
- ArrowDown indicator shows when alphabetical sort is active
- Clicking any app icon column switches back to ranking sort for that app

Worker re-structure — dual queue architecture (PLA-14):
- Problem: single BullMQ queue (scraper-jobs) with concurrency=1 meant user-triggered jobs waited behind long-running scheduled jobs
- Solution: two separate queues with dedicated workers in separate containers
  - scraper-jobs-interactive: processes user-triggered jobs (track app, track keyword, add competitor) with no rate limiter
  - scraper-jobs-background: processes scheduled/cron jobs, cascade jobs, admin triggers with rate limiter (1 job/5s)
- Shared job processor: process-job.ts extracted from worker.ts, both workers import the same processJob function
- API routing: account.ts routes → interactive queue, scheduler/admin → background queue
- Cascade jobs always go to background queue (not user-blocking)
- System admin scraper page shows per-queue breakdown (interactive/background) with combined totals
- Queue management endpoints (pause/resume/drain/clear) operate on both queues
- Trigger endpoint accepts optional queue parameter (default: background)
- Docker: same Dockerfile.worker image, two services in docker-compose (worker + worker-interactive)
- Files: queue.ts, process-job.ts (new), worker.ts, interactive-worker.ts (new), account.ts, system-admin.ts, admin.ts, scraper page, docker-compose.prod.yml, package.json

Queue tracking in scrape_runs (PLA-17):
- New DB column: scrape_runs.queue (varchar(20), nullable for backward compat)
- Migration: 0036_scrape_runs_queue.sql — simple ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN
- createProcessJob() accepts queueName parameter, workers pass "background" or "interactive"
- All scrape_run inserts include queue: category-scraper (crawl, scrapeSingle), app-details-scraper (scrapeTracked, scrapeApp), review-scraper (scrapeTracked), keyword-scraper (scrapeAll), keyword-suggestion-scraper (scrapeAll), compute-review-metrics, compute-similarity-scores, process-job inline inserts (keyword_search single, keyword_suggestions single, reviews single)
- API: GET /api/system-admin/scraper/runs now supports ?queue=interactive|background filter
- Dashboard Run History table: new "Queue" column with badge (interactive/background), queue filter dropdown alongside type/trigger filters
- Existing runs have queue=null (shown as dash in UI)
- Cascade jobs inherit the originating queue: when app_details runs on interactive queue, its cascade jobs (compute_similarity_scores, reviews, etc.) also go to the interactive queue instead of always defaulting to background
- cascadeOpts computed once from queueName in createProcessJob(), passed to all 7 enqueueScraperJob cascade calls
- Files: scrape-runs.ts, 0036_scrape_runs_queue.sql, process-job.ts, worker.ts, interactive-worker.ts, category-scraper.ts, app-details-scraper.ts, review-scraper.ts, keyword-scraper.ts, keyword-suggestion-scraper.ts, compute-review-metrics.ts, compute-similarity-scores.ts, system-admin.ts (API), scraper/page.tsx, scraper-page.test.tsx

Momentum column alignment (PLA-19):
- Fixed MomentumBadge alignment across all tables (competitors, app competitors, app list)
- MomentumBadge: added fixed width (w-[4.5rem]) so all momentum states align consistently regardless of label length
- Added justify-center to null/unknown states for consistent centering
- Added gap-0.5 between emoji and label, font-medium on label for better readability
- All momentum TableHead and TableCell elements now have text-center class
- Skeleton loading state in competitors-section centered with mx-auto
- Files changed: momentum-badge.tsx, competitors/page.tsx, competitors-section.tsx, app-list-table.tsx

Compare page sorting (PLA-17):
- Fixed default sorting in 4 comparison tables: Languages, Integrations, Category Features, Category Rankings
- New sorting logic: primary app (apps[0]) items first, sorted alphabetically; then remaining items sorted alphabetically
- BadgeComparisonSection (Languages, Integrations): changed from count-desc to primary-first sorting
- CategoryRankingSection: categories where primary app has a ranking appear first
- CategoriesComparison (Category Features): features within each subcategory sorted primary-first
- File changed: apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/apps/[slug]/compare/page.tsx

Competitor suggestions table redesign (PLA-20):
- Redesigned competitor-suggestions.tsx from single-line horizontal layout to two-line card layout
- Row 1: Larger icon (8x8), full app name (no truncation), star rating with review count, Shopify link, Add/Added button
- Row 2: Badges (Built for Shopify, Similar), similarity bar + percentage, category rank badges, pricing hint
- Second row indented with pl-[42px] to align under app name (past icon)
- Rating moved from far right to directly next to app name with amber star icon
- "Built for Shopify" now shown as text badge (violet) instead of diamond emoji
- Shimmer loading skeleton updated to match two-line layout
- Icon size increased from h-6 w-6 to h-8 w-8 for better visual hierarchy
- File changed: apps/dashboard/src/components/competitor-suggestions.tsx

App detail overview tab redesign (PLA-22):
- Complete rewrite of app overview page (/apps/[slug]) from static summary cards to 6 dynamic dashboard cards
- 2-column responsive grid (1-col mobile, 2-col desktop), each card clickable with hover border effect
- Card 1 — Review Pulse: velocity strip (7d/30d/90d counts, green if positive), MomentumBadge, mini rating distribution bars, 3 latest reviews with relative dates
- Card 2 — Keyword Performance (tracked only): "X of Y ranked" header, top 3 movers with position deltas (colored arrows), top 3 best positions, empty state with CTA
- Card 3 — Category Rankings: each category with position badge + change indicator (up/down/steady arrows), computed from time-series latest vs previous
- Card 4 — Competitor Watch (tracked only): "Tracking X competitors" header, self position by rating ("2nd of 6"), top 5 competitor list with icons/ratings, empty state with CTA
- Card 5 — Listing Changes: grouped by recency (Today/This Week/Earlier), colored field badges per change type, up to 5 recent changes
- Card 6 — Visibility & Discovery: 3 sub-sections (Featured editorial sections, Search Ads keywords, Similar Apps reverse count), each independently linked to its tab
- Untracked apps show 4 cards (Review Pulse, Category Rankings, Listing Changes, Visibility) — no keyword/competitor cards
- All empty states with muted icons, descriptive text, and optional CTA buttons
- API helper: getAppReviewMetrics(slug) wraps getAppsReviewVelocity for single-slug convenience
- No backend API changes — all data from existing endpoints
- Helper functions: relativeDate(), ordinal(), computeRankingChanges() for time-series delta computation
- Field badge colors: distinct per field type (blue/purple/indigo/green/amber/orange/pink)
- Files changed: apps/dashboard/src/lib/api.ts, apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/apps/[slug]/page.tsx

Overview page section counts (PLA-24):
- Added item counts to all 5 section titles on the /overview dashboard page
- "My Apps" → "My Apps (X)", "Tracked Keywords (X)", "Competitor Apps (X)", "Starred Features (X)", "Starred Categories (X)"
- Counts come from existing state arrays (apps.length, keywords.length, etc.)
- File changed: apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/overview/page.tsx

Overview tab improvements (PLA-23):
- Listing Changes card: now shows competitor updates (not own app) for tracked apps with competitors; falls back to own changes for untracked apps
  - Fetches up to 3 changes per competitor (max 10 competitors) in parallel, merges and sorts by date
  - Each entry shows competitor icon + name + field badge + relative date
  - Card title changes to "Competitor Updates" when showing competitor data
- Visibility card: "Active on X keywords" changed to "Advertising on X keywords" with an "Ad" badge to clarify these are sponsored/paid placements
- Keyword Performance: fixed "0 of N keywords ranked" bug — getAppKeywords without appSlugs param returns empty rankings object; now uses kwChanges count from getAppRankings time-series instead
- Keyword Performance: fixed unranked keywords showing in Top Positions — computeRankingChanges now filters out entries with position <= 0 or null
- Competitor Watch: fixed star character showing as HTML entity "&starf;" — replaced with Lucide Star icon component for consistent rendering
- Competitor Watch: added multi-metric ranking (by rating, by reviews, by cheapest price) in a grid layout instead of single "by rating" line
  - Fetches self app's minPaidPrice via getAppsMinPaidPrices in Round 1
  - Price ranking only shown when self has a valid paid price
- Replaced all HTML entities (&rarr;, &middot;, &starf;) with Unicode characters or React components for reliable rendering
- Files changed: apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/apps/[slug]/page.tsx

Overview tab follow-up improvements (PLA-22 comment):
- Category Rankings card: added category leaders (top 3 apps) for each category
  - Fetches getCategory(slug) for each category in parallel with Round 2
  - Shows position badge, icon, and name for top 3 ranked apps under each category row
  - categoryLeadersMap stores leaders per category slug

  - Each row is a clickable Link to /apps/{competitorSlug}/changes
  - Footer "View all competitors" links to /apps/{slug}/competitors (not changes page)
  - Card no longer wrapped in outer Link (inner rows have individual links)
  - ChangeGroup component simplified (removed showCompetitor prop, only used for own changes)
- Category Rankings card: added app count per category from latestSnapshot.appCount
  - Displayed as "Support > Chat (142)" next to category label
  - categoryLeadersMap renamed to categoryInfoMap storing { leaders, appCount }
- Files changed: apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/apps/[slug]/page.tsx

App detail stat cards tablet responsiveness (PLA-21):
- Fixed stat cards (Rating, Reviews, Pricing, Developer, Launched, Last Updated) overlapping on tablet/narrow desktop
- Changed grid breakpoints: grid-cols-2 → sm:grid-cols-3 → lg:grid-cols-6 (was md:grid-cols-6)
- At tablet width (768-1023px) cards now show in 3 columns (2 rows) instead of cramped 6 columns
- Added min-w-0 to all cards to prevent grid blowout from long content
- Added truncate to developer name link for long developer names
- File changed: apps/dashboard/src/app/(dashboard)/apps/[slug]/layout.tsx

Competitor suggestions (PLA-12):
- Similarity utilities extracted from scraper to packages/shared/src/similarity.ts
  - STOP_WORDS, jaccard(), tokenize(), extractCategorySlugs(), extractFeatureHandles(), computeSimilarityBetween()
  - SIMILARITY_WEIGHTS constant (category/feature/keyword/text each 25%)
  - AppSimilarityData and SimilarityResult types
- Scraper's compute-similarity-scores.ts updated to import from @shopify-tracking/shared
- API: GET /api/account/tracked-apps/:slug/competitor-suggestions?limit=20
  - On-demand computation, no storage table — candidates from top 24 apps per category via appCategoryRankings
  - Batch-fetches snapshots, app info, keyword rankings for all candidates + tracked app in parallel
  - Computes Jaccard similarity for each candidate across 4 dimensions
  - Bonus +5% for apps listed in similarAppSightings
  - Excludes tracked app, marks already-added competitors with isAlreadyCompetitor flag
  - Response: appSlug, appName, iconUrl, averageRating, ratingCount, pricingHint, isBuiltForShopify, isAlreadyCompetitor, similarity scores, categoryRanks, isShopifySimilar
- Dashboard: CompetitorSuggestions component (competitor-suggestions.tsx)
  - Follows MetadataKeywordSuggestions pattern: collapsible panel, amber-styled button, lazy loading
  - Prominent mode: auto-opens when no competitors added (empty state)
  - Each suggestion: app icon + name (linked), BFS badge, similarity bar (color-coded), score breakdown tooltip, category rank badges, rating + reviews, pricing hint, external link, add button
  - Added state: Check icon for already-added competitors
  - Footer: similarity weight legend
- Integrated into competitors-section.tsx between search bar and competitors table
- 25 new tests for similarity utilities (jaccard, tokenize, extractCategorySlugs, extractFeatureHandles, computeSimilarityBetween, SIMILARITY_WEIGHTS, STOP_WORDS)
