# Interpreting the Category Tree CSV

This guide explains how to use the **category tree CSV** when deciding **whether to enter a category** with a new app. It focuses on the most important factors for that decision and how to use this document and the CSV in your workflow.

The CSV is generated by `shopify-category-tree-report.py` from the JSON produced by the category tree scraper. For **app details** and **review** data structures, see [SHOPIFY_DATA_STRUCTURE.md](SHOPIFY_DATA_STRUCTURE.md).

---

## What the CSV is

- **One row per category.** Rows are flattened from the nested category tree.
- **Level 0** = root categories (e.g. “Finding products apps”). These rows have **empty metrics and app columns**; they are structural only.
- **Level 1–4** = subcategories. These rows contain all metrics and the top-8 app columns. Use these for “enter or not” analysis.
- **Source:** All columns come from `shopify-category-tree-report.py` (including the last six: `opportunity_score`, `room`, `demand`, `organic`, `maturity_component`, `quality_opportunity`).

## How to use this document when deciding to enter a category

1. **Filter** to categories you care about (e.g. by Level0/Level1 or by reading `description`).
2. **Score or flag** each row using the key factors below (concentration, market size, maturity, paid competition, who’s on top).
3. **Use the CSV as a first filter:** shortlist categories that meet your thresholds, then validate with product/market research and strategy (differentiation, capacity).
4. **Revisit** this doc when comparing two categories or when explaining why you entered or skipped one.

**Why this doc helps:** It gives a single place for definitions (so everyone reads metrics the same way), a checklist of what to look at before entering, and shared language (“high concentration”, “mature category”, etc.) for discussions.

## Most important factors for “enter or not”

### 1. Concentration of power (top_1_pct_reviews, top_4_pct_reviews, top_8_pct_reviews)

**What it is:** Percentage of the first page’s total reviews held by the top 1, top 4, or top 8 apps (by review count).

- **High %:** A few apps dominate the first page (winner-takes-most). Harder for a new entrant to get visibility unless you have a clear angle or distribution.
- **Low %:** Reviews are more spread across apps. There may be more room for newcomers on the first page.

**Why it matters for entry:** This is the **primary signal for “is there room on the first page?”** If most reviews are already concentrated in a handful of apps, organic visibility will be harder.

---

### 2. Market size vs competition (app_count, total_reviews)

- **app_count:** Total number of apps in the category (full category, from Shopify).
- **total_reviews:** Sum of review counts across the **first 24 apps only** (not the whole category).

- **High app_count:** Large market, many players. Often means proven demand but also more competition.
- **Low app_count:** Smaller niche. Can mean easier differentiation or less demand; not automatically good or bad.

**Why it matters for entry:** Use together with strategy. “Big and concentrated” (high app_count + high top_*_pct) suggests a crowded, leader-heavy space. “Small and fragmented” (low app_count + lower concentration) might allow a focused play. Size alone does not equal opportunity; some small categories are very profitable.

### 3. Maturity and barriers (count_100_plus_reviews, count_1000_plus_reviews, built_for_shopify_count)

- **count_100_plus_reviews / count_1000_plus_reviews:** How many of the first 24 apps have ≥100 or ≥1000 reviews.
- **built_for_shopify_count:** How many of the first 24 have the “Built for Shopify” badge.

- **High values:** Established, curated category. First page is dominated by mature apps; harder to break in but demand is proven.
- **Low values:** Newer or less polished space. Possible opportunity, but less proof of demand.

**Why it matters for entry:** Tells you how “established” the visible part of the category is and whether you’re competing with many well-reviewed, Shopify-curated apps.

---

### 4. Paid competition (sponsored_count)

**What it is:** Number of apps in the first 24 that are marked as sponsored/paid.

- **High:** Category is monetised; advertisers compete for placement. Factor this in if you rely on organic vs paid visibility.
- **Low:** Less paid competition in the first view.

**Why it matters for entry:** Helps you judge how much paid spend is in play and whether organic discovery is still realistic.

---

### 5. Who is on top (app_1 … app_8)

**What it is:** The top 8 apps by review count on the first page, formatted as “App name (rating, review count)”.

**Why it matters for entry:** Use this to ask: **Can we differentiate from these?** and **Do we have the capacity to compete with these players?** If the leaders are strong and well-funded, entry may require a clear niche or different positioning.

---

### 6. Opportunity score and component columns

The report generated by `shopify-category-tree-report.py` includes **six columns at the end** of the CSV:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **opportunity_score** | 0–100 composite score: higher = more opportunity to enter (room, demand, organic room, lower maturity, quality gap). Level-0 rows are empty. |
| **room** | 0–1: how much “room” on the first page (low concentration → high room). |
| **demand** | 0–1: market signal from total_reviews (capped). |
| **organic** | 0–1: fewer sponsored apps → higher. |
| **maturity_component** | 0–1: fewer apps with 1000+ reviews → higher (easier to break in). |
| **quality_opportunity** | 0–1: few Built for Shopify apps and top-4 rating not near 5 → higher (room for a quality app to rise). |

**Composite formula:**  
`opportunity_score = round(100 * (0.35*room + 0.20*demand + 0.15*organic + 0.10*maturity_component + 0.20*quality_opportunity))` (clamped to 0–100).

**How each component is scored** (all inputs from the same row’s metrics; result clamped to 0–1 unless noted):

| Component | Input(s) | Scoring |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **room** | `top_8_pct_reviews` | `(100 - top_8_pct_reviews) / 100`. Low concentration → high room. |
| **demand** | `total_reviews` | `min(1, total_reviews / 10000)`; 0 if `total_reviews` is 0. |
| **organic** | `sponsored_count` | `(24 - sponsored_count) / 24`. Fewer sponsored → higher. |
| **maturity_component** | `count_1000_plus_reviews` | `maturity_penalty = min(1, count_1000_plus_reviews / 12)`; then `1 - maturity_penalty`. Fewer 1000+ apps → higher. |
| **quality_opportunity** | `built_for_shopify_count`, `top_4_avg_rating` | `bfs_factor = (1 - built_for_shopify_count/24)`; `rating_factor = 0.5` if rating missing, else `(1 - (top_4_avg_rating - 3.5)/1.5)`; then `bfs_factor * rating_factor`. Few BFS and top rating not near 5 → higher. |

Use the score as a **first filter**; combine it with product fit and strategy. The five component columns let you see why a category scored high or low.

## What to treat with caution

- **First-page only:** All metrics except `app_count` are based on the **first 24 apps** (one page). They do not represent the full category.
- **Point in time:** Data is from the day of the scrape. Rankings and counts change over time.
- **Level-0 rows:** No metrics; ignore them for analysis.
- **One input among many:** The CSV is a useful filter and comparison tool, but the final “enter or not” decision should combine it with product fit, differentiation, and market research.

## Metric definitions (for lookup)

- **top_1_pct_reviews / top_4_pct_reviews / top_8_pct_reviews:** Share of the first page’s total reviews held by the top 1, 4, or 8 apps (by review count). “First page” = first 24 apps only.
- **app_count:** Total apps in the category from Shopify (“X apps”).
- **sponsored_count:** Number of the first 24 apps that are sponsored/paid. Not a quality signal by itself.
- **built_for_shopify_count:** Number of the first 24 apps with the “Built for Shopify” badge.
- **count_100_plus_reviews / count_1000_plus_reviews:** Number of the first 24 apps with ≥100 or ≥1000 reviews.
